## How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Harivamsi-17/carpooling-app.git
    ```
2.  **Backend Setup:**
    * Make sure you have Java 21 and PostgreSQL installed.
    * Create a local PostgreSQL database.
    * In `src/main/resources/application.properties`, update the `spring.datasource` properties to point to your local database.
    * Set your JWT secret in the same file.
    * Run the Spring Boot application from your IDE.
3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    * In the main JavaScript file (e.g., `src/main/resources/static/js/app.js`), change the `API_BASE_URL` to your local backend address (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
    * Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
